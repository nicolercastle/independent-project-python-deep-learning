Deep learning project comparing logistic regression, MLP, and CNN models for multi-class classification using Python.

# Python Deep Learning Independent Project

This repository contains the full code pipeline for an independent deep learning project completed during finals week. The goal was to use deep learning to analyze a real-world data set.  I compared logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models for multi-class classification using a real-world wine quality dataset.

## Overview

- Built and compared three classification models: logistic regression, MLP, and CNN
- Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction and SMOTE for class balancing
- Evaluated performance using accuracy and validation loss
- Designed and trained deep learning architectures using TensorFlow/Keras
- Visualized performance metrics and model comparisons
- Delivered a reproducible pipeline and professional report

## Tools Used

- Python (`NumPy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`/`Keras`, `matplotlib`, `imbalanced-learn`)
- Deep learning model architecture design and evaluation
- Data preprocessing, scaling, and encoding
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA) and class balancing (SMOTE)
- Performance metric visualization
  
## Project Highlights
